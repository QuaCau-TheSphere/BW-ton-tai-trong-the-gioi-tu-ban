Khái niệm:: 

The SIM card isn't necessary for your phone to send radio signals to cell phone towers. All the technology is already there in your phone. It's just that cell towers are programmed not to accept any requests from phones who can't authorize themselves. Basically, your phone goes "hey tower, I'd like to place a call please", and the tower goes "okay, what's the password?". And if your phone can't give the password, then the call doesn't get placed. The job of the SIM card is to provide the password. (It's not literally a password, but you can think of it that way.)

The only exception is an emergency call. Cell towers are programmed with a list of numbers that any phone can place calls to, password or no. So no, there is no hack or workaround. You end up going "hey can I place a call to 911?", and the tower goes "yeah okay, no password necessary for that". And then you go "oh no actually call my mom". And then the tower says "okay, password please?". There's no getting around it - you can't both call an emergency number _and_ your mom (unless your mom happens to be a 911 operator and you're willing to roll the dice).
