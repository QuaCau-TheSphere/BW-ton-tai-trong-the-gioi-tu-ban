Khái niệm:: 
One thing to watch out for: profit doesn’t say anything about your bank account. The bank account is a green node, but we’re only looking at blue nodes here. In this example, you ended up with $23,995 in the bank, even though investors put in $25,000: you made a profit, yet still have less money in the bank than you did before, because Customer 2 hasn’t yet fully paid. That’s why it’s possible for a company to be profitable but still run out of money!
