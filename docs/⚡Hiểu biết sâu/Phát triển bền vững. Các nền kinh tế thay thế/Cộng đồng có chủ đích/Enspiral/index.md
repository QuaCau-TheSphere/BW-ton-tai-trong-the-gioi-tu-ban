## Ra quyết định
Có 4 cấp độ phản hồi đề xuất: đồng ý, phiếu trắng, phản đối, và chặn

| position | meaning                                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| YES      | You’re happy with the proposal.                                                                    |
| ABSTAIN  | You’re happy for the group to decide without you.                                                  |
| NO       | You think there might be a better alternative, but you’re willing to go with the group’s decision. |
| BLOCK    | You’ve got serious objections and you’ll be extremely unhappy if this proposal goes ahead.         |

### [Blocking](https://handbook.enspiral.com/agreements/decisions.html#blocking)

**At Enspiral, a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal proceeding in most cases. This places a considerable responsibility on someone blocking to deeply consider their choice, and on everyone involved to respect the right to block and to work toward a resolution.**

A decision to block should not be taken lightly, but if you feel strongly about an issue and really want to stop a proposal you actually need to block it, because simply disagreeing or arguing against is not a guarantee that it won't be passed.

**Blocking Policies**

- Place the good of the whole group above your own individual preferences.
- You are not required to propose an alternative solution to raise a block, but you must articulate the nature of your block clearly so the group can understand the concern and work toward a resolution.
- Simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking - you must be prepared to work collaboratively to try and reach a resolution, make time for conversations, and to help others understand the issue.
- Blocks should only be used in cases where the blocker genuinely believes there is a significant risk of harm to the network, or that the proposal contravenes the fundamental values of Enspiral.

[Newcomers - Enspiral Handbook](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/newcomers.html):
- Join because you think this might be a place where you fit, not because you need Enspiral to do, be or deliver something specific.
- Similarly, an Enspiral retreat may embrace one set of values (vegetarian meals) and ignore another (minimising carbon footprint)
- So whilst Enspiral is ‘purpose-agnostic’, there will be boundaries, and those boundaries have not been defined. The work of doing so will likely happen only as the need arises, which can be seen as either efficient prioritisation of capacity or perpetuating a lack of clarity. Or anything in between.
