Khái niệm:: 
You need 2+ spaces to end an account name (because space and semicolon are allowed in account names. Run `hledger accounts -d` to see what happened.) 

use `aregister` for reviewing and reconciling real-world asset/liability accounts - use `register` for reviewing detailed revenues/expenses.
